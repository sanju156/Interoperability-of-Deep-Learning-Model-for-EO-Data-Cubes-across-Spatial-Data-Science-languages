# Interoperability-of-Deep-Learning-Model-for-Earth Observation-Data-Cubes-across-Spatial-Data-Science-languages
Code, trained models, and ONNX export workflows for the Master’s thesis, Interoperability of Deep Learning Model for Earth Observation Data Cubes across Spatial Data Science Languages. Includes TempCNN experiments across Python (PyTorch), R (torch), and Julia (Flux), with containerised, reproducible cross-language inference experiments.

# Overview
This work focuses on reproducibility and cross-language interoperability of deep learning models for Earth Observation (EO) data cubes, with a particular emphasis on Temporal Convolutional Neural Networks (TempCNN) for satellite time-series classification.

Three native implementations of the same TempCNN architecture are provided:

1. Python (PyTorch) – 

2. R (torch) – 

3. Julia (Flux) –
